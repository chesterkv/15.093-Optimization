This folder contains station-related data. The following files were obtained using BlueBikes' real time API, on XX:
- station_information.json
- station_status.json
- system_regions.json

The relevant information from these files was extracted and stored in corresponding CSV files, easier to manipulate.

Finally the top200-stations.csv corresponds to the the ids of the subset of stations gathered the most demand in the period of study, and that were considered in our analysis.
